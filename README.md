# The Mesilla Valley Homesteader's Pantry

Howdy, neighbors! Welcome to our Community Canning Book. I'm a homesteader here in the Mesilla Valley, and over the years I've filled my pantry with jars of tomatoes, preserves, pickles, and all manner of good things put by for the winter.

This here book is a gathering of our shared knowledge—recipes passed down, tried and true methods for putting up the harvest, and new ideas from folks across the valley. Whether you're putting up your first batch of tomatoes or looking for a new way to pickle green beans, I hope you find something useful.

I invite every homesteader to add their own recipes. Together we can keep our traditions alive and our shelves full.
