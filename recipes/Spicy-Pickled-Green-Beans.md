# Spicy Pickled Green Beans

These crisp, tangy beans are a favorite on our table. The heat from the chiles and the bite of garlic make them a fine companion to cold meats, or just a satisfying snack straight from the jar.

## Ingredients
- 2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
- 4–6 small dried red chiles (such as chile de árbol)
- 4–6 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly smashed
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon dill seeds (optional)
- 2½ cups white vinegar (5% acidity)
- 2½ cups water
- ¼ cup canning salt (do not use iodized salt)

## Equipment
- Pint canning jars, lids, and rings
- Large boiling‑water canner
- Jar lifter, funnel, and bubble remover
- Clean towels

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the beans:** Wash the beans thoroughly and trim off the stem ends. Leave them whole or cut into lengths that fit your jars, leaving about ½ inch of headspace.

2. **Pack the jars:** Sterilize the jars by boiling them for 10 minutes; keep them hot. Into each hot pint jar place 1–2 dried chiles, 1–2 cloves of garlic, ¼ teaspoon peppercorns, ¼ teaspoon mustard seeds, and ¼ teaspoon dill seeds (if using).

3. **Add the beans:** Pack the green beans vertically into the jars, standing them up as tightly as possible without crushing them. Leave ½ inch of headspace.

4. **Make the brine:** In a non‑reactive saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, and canning salt. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt.

5. **Fill the jars:** Pour the hot brine over the beans, maintaining the ½‑inch headspace. Run a bubble remover or a clean wooden chopstick around the inside of the jar to release any trapped air.

6. **Seal the jars:** Wipe the rims with a clean damp cloth. Place a hot lid on each jar and screw on the ring until fingertip‑tight.

7. **Process:** Lower the jars into the boiling‑water canner, ensuring they are covered by at least 1 inch of water. Bring back to a full boil and process pints for 10 minutes (adjust for altitude if needed).

8. **Cool and store:** Remove the jars with a jar lifter and set them on a towel‑lined counter, away from drafts. Let them cool undisturbed for 12–24 hours. Check that the lids have sealed (they should be concave and not flex when pressed). Store in a cool, dark pantry.

## Notes
- For a milder pickle, use fewer chiles or remove the seeds from the chiles before adding.
- These beans need at least two weeks in the jar for the flavors to fully develop.
- Always use vinegar with 5% acidity for safe pickling.
- The beans will keep for a year or more.
