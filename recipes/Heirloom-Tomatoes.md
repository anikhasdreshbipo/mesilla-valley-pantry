# Heirloom Tomatoes - Canned Whole

These tomatoes are the pride of my garden. Their rich flavor holds up beautifully in the jar, ready to be used in stews, sauces, or simply enjoyed on their own.

## Ingredients
- 10 pounds ripe heirloom tomatoes (any variety, but meaty ones like Brandywine work best)
- Canning salt (1 teaspoon per quart jar)
- Lemon juice or citric acid (2 tablespoons bottled lemon juice per quart jar, or 1/2 teaspoon citric acid)
- Fresh basil leaves (optional, one per jar)
- Boiling water

## Equipment
- Quart canning jars, lids, and rings
- Large boiling‑water canner
- Jar lifter, funnel, and bubble remover
- Clean towels

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the tomatoes:** Wash the tomatoes thoroughly. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Score a small “X” on the bottom of each tomato with a knife. Dip tomatoes into the boiling water for 30–60 seconds, then transfer immediately to a bowl of ice water. The skins will slip right off.

2. **Pack the jars:** Sterilize the jars by boiling them for 10 minutes; keep them hot. To each hot quart jar, add 1 teaspoon canning salt and 2 tablespoons bottled lemon juice (or ½ teaspoon citric acid). If using basil, place one leaf in the jar.

3. **Fill with tomatoes:** Pack the peeled tomatoes into the jar, pressing gently to remove air pockets but not crushing them. Leave ½ inch of headspace.

4. **Add boiling water:** Pour boiling water over the tomatoes, maintaining the ½‑inch headspace. Run a bubble remover or a clean wooden chopstick around the inside of the jar to release any trapped air.

5. **Seal the jars:** Wipe the rims with a clean damp cloth. Place a hot lid on each jar and screw on the ring until fingertip‑tight.

6. **Process:** Lower the jars into the boiling‑water canner, ensuring they are covered by at least 1 inch of water. Bring back to a full boil and process quarts for 45 minutes (adjust for altitude if needed).

7. **Cool and store:** Remove the jars with a jar lifter and set them on a towel‑lined counter, away from drafts. Let them cool undisturbed for 12–24 hours. Check that the lids have sealed (they should be concave and not flex when pressed). Store in a cool, dark pantry.

## Notes
- Always use bottled lemon juice or citric acid to ensure a safe acidity level for canning.
- If your tomatoes are very juicy, you may not need to add extra water—the tomatoes’ own juice will fill the jar.
- These canned tomatoes keep well for a year or more.
