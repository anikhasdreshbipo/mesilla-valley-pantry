# Peach Preserves with a Hint of Cinnamon

This recipe comes from Eleanor on the East Mesa. The warmth of cinnamon complements the sweetness of ripe peaches, making a preserve that's perfect on biscuits or spooned over morning porridge.

## Ingredients
- 4 pounds ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, and chopped
- 4 cups granulated sugar
- ¼ cup bottled lemon juice (to ensure safe acidity)
- 2 cinnamon sticks (or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon)
- 1 package (1.75 oz) powdered fruit pectin (optional, for a firmer set)

## Equipment
- Heavy‑bottomed preserving pot or large saucepan
- Canning jars, lids, and rings (half‑pint or pint)
- Boiling‑water canner
- Jar lifter, funnel, and bubble remover
- Clean towels

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the peaches:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Score a small “X” on the bottom of each peach. Dip peaches into the boiling water for 30–60 seconds, then transfer immediately to a bowl of ice water. The skins will slip right off. Pit the peaches and chop them into small pieces (about ½‑inch).

2. **Combine ingredients:** In the preserving pot, combine the chopped peaches, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon sticks (or ground cinnamon). If using powdered pectin, stir it into the fruit before adding the sugar.

3. **Cook the preserves:** Bring the mixture to a full rolling boil over medium‑high heat, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Boil hard for 1 minute, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring often, until the mixture thickens and reaches the jelling point (about 20–30 minutes).

4. **Test for jelling:** To check if the preserves are ready, place a small spoonful on a chilled plate and let it cool for a minute. If the surface wrinkles when you push it with your finger, the jelling point has been reached. Alternatively, use a candy thermometer; the mixture should reach 220°F (104°C) at sea level.

5. **Prepare jars:** While the preserves are cooking, sterilize the jars by boiling them for 10 minutes; keep them hot.

6. **Fill the jars:** Remove the cinnamon sticks (if using sticks). Ladle the hot preserves into the hot jars, leaving ¼ inch of headspace. Run a bubble remover or a clean wooden chopstick around the inside of the jar to release any trapped air.

7. **Seal the jars:** Wipe the rims with a clean damp cloth. Place a hot lid on each jar and screw on the ring until fingertip‑tight.

8. **Process:** Lower the jars into the boiling‑water canner, ensuring they are covered by at least 1 inch of water. Bring back to a full boil and process half‑pints or pints for 10 minutes (adjust for altitude if needed).

9. **Cool and store:** Remove the jars with a jar lifter and set them on a towel‑lined counter, away from drafts. Let them cool undisturbed for 12–24 hours. Check that the lids have sealed (they should be concave and not flex when pressed). Store in a cool, dark pantry.

## Notes
- For a stronger cinnamon flavor, add an extra cinnamon stick or let the sticks steep in the finished preserves for a few minutes before removing.
- If you prefer a smoother preserve, you can mash the peaches with a potato masher partway through cooking.
- These preserves keep well for a year or more.
